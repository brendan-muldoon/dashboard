    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      The application aims to simplify and streamline the process of tracking
      APIs and identifying errors. It provides a uniformed way of monitoring
      APIs and reduces the time and effort required to investigate issues. The
      application is designed as a prototype and currently only supports Spring Boot
      applications. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive features,
      the application is a valuable tool for developers and IT professionals who
      want to optimize their API management and troubleshooting processes. By
      leveraging the power of this application, developers can minimize errors,
      improve efficiency, and ultimately, deliver better products and services.
